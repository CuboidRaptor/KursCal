# KursCal
A Kursed Calculator that uses RPN, emulated nvim keybindings, and a weird reproducible script for calculations.

# Dev Stuff
coded on python 3.12.x, will possibly/probably work on earlier/later versions of python \
have tkinter installed \
should work on all OSes for now, however official support is provided for linux and \"maybe\" support is provided for Windows. \

# NVim Inconsistencies
`^` and `_` ignore leading whitespace unlike in neovim but idc it's a calculator that like doesn't happen \
`w` and `W`, and `b` and `B` do the same thing. Yes, I know, yada yada words are not WORDS, but again this is a calculator it's probably fine. \(they both use WORDs.\)
