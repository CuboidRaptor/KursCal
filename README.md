# KursCal
A Kursed Calculator that uses RPN, a stack for storing answers, and a weird reproducible script for calculations.

# Dev Stuff
coded on python 3.12.x, will possibly work on earlier/later versions of python
install pyside6 through pip
also build qtermwidget, lxqt-build-tools from source (yes I know it sucks)
also install development qt6 tools (qt6-qttools-devel on fedora/dnf5)
potentially more things depending on what's already installed in your linux distro
pip install PyQt-builder also for building python bindings for qtermwidget
I may add windows support if I get bored enough
